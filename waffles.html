                <li>1 egg</li>

                <li>1/3 Cup of water</li>

                <li>1/4 Teaspoon of vanilla</li>

                <li>2 Tablespoons of cooking oil</li>

            </ul>

                Preparation
            </h3>

            <p>
                First get your waffle maker plugged in and heating up. 
                Or a griddle if you want to turn this into pandcakes. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Next mix your dry and wet ingredients separately. 
                Preferably, mix your wet ingredients in a larger sized bowl 
                as you will be adding the dry into the wet.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are making waffles mix the dry and wet ingredients together 
                untill the mixture is smooth. <br>If you are going for pandcakes try 
                to mix the dough less so that it stays a bit lumpy.
            </p>

            <p>
                I find that most 8 inch waffle makers like just over 1/2 cup of 
                batter, or 1 and a half of the 1/3 cup sized scoops. (If you don't 
                want to wash extra dishes.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Makes 2 of the 8 inch waffles, or 4 of the 1/3 cup sized pandcakes. <br>
                Increase batter volume as needed. 1-2 eggs worth of batter feeds 
                a hungry man. 
            </p>
